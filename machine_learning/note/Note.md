### Capture Uncertainty 
> Issues:
>     1.  Samples $$(X,Y)$$ are not drawn from the acutal distribution (perhaps unknown).
>     2.  Samples $$(X,Y)$$ are  drawn from from a known distribution but comprises only a small part of the $$\mathcal X\times \mathcal Y$$ space.



## Possible Strategies:
### 1. Inherently Safe Design 
Inherently safe design is the exclusion of a potential hazard from the system (instead of controlling the hazard).

#### 1.1 Interptable Models 
Interptable models exclude features that are not causally related to the outcome. Features or functions capturing quirks in the data can be noted and excluded, thereby avoiding related harm. Similarly, by carefully selecting variables that are causally related to the outcome, phenomena that are not a part of the true ‘physics’ of the system can be excluded, and associated harm be avoided.

### 2. Safety Reserves 
* A safety factor is a ratio between the maximal load that does not lead to failure and the load for which the system was designed. 
* A safety margin is the difference between the two.

The uncertainty in the matching of training and test data distributions or in the instantiation of the test set can be parameterized  with the symbol $$\theta$$. Let $$R^*( \theta)$$ be the risk of the risk-optimal model if the  $$\theta$$ were known. Along the same lines as safety factors and safety margins, robust formulations find h while constraining or minimizing $$\max_{\theta}\frac{R^*(h,\theta)}{R^*(\theta)}$$ or   $$\max_{\theta}R^*(h,\theta)-R^*(\theta)$$



Such formulations can capture uncertainty in the class priors and uncertainty resulting from label noise in classification problems

## 3. Safe Fail 

A system remains safe when it fails in its intended operation.
#### Reject Option
A technique used in machine learning when predictions cannot be given confidently is the reject option: the model reports that it cannot reliably give a prediction and does not attempt to do so, thereby failing safely.

## Example Application

## Surgical Robots

In autonomous robotic surgery, a machine learning enabled surgical robot continuously estimates the state of the environment (e.g., length or thickness of soft tissues under surgery) based on the measurements from sensors (e.g., image data or force signals) and generates a plan for executing actions (e.g., moving the robotic instruments along a trajectory). The mapping function from the perception of environment to the robotic actions is considered as a surgical skill which the robot learns, through evaluation of its own actions or from observing the actions of expert surgeons. The quality of the learned surgical skills can be assessed using cost functions that are either automatically learned or are manually defined by surgeons.

Given the uncertainty and large variability in the operator actions and behavior, organ/tissue movements and dynamics, and possibility of incidental failures in the robotic system and instruments, predicting all possible system states and outcomes and assessing their associated costs is very challenging.  For example, there have been ongoing reports of safety incidents during use of surgical robots that negatively impact patients by  causing procedure interruptions or minor injuries. These incidents happen despite existing safe
fail mechanisms included in the system and often result from a combination of different causal factors and unexpected conditions, including malfunctions of surgical instruments, actions taken  by the surgeon, and the patient’s medical history .



#### Possible Solutions

One solution for dealing with these uncertainties is to assess the robustness of the system in the presence of unwanted and rare hazardous events (e.g., failures in control system, noisy sensor measurements, or incorrect commands sent by novice operators) by simulating such events in virtual environments [7]  and quantifying the possibility of making safe decisions by the learning algorithm.



Another solution currently adopted in practice is through supervisory control of automated surgical tasks instead of fully autonomous surgery. For example, if the robot generates a geometrically optimized suture plan based on sensor data or surgeon input, it should still be tracked and updated in real time because of possible tissue motion and deformation during surgery [5].  This is an example of examining interpretable models to avoid possible harm.



 An example of adopting safety reserves (Section III-2) in robotic surgery is robust optimization of preoperative planning to minimize the uncertainty at the task level while maximizing the dexterity [8]

## Self-Driving Cars:

Self-driving cars are autonomous cyber-physical systems capable of making intelligent navigation decisions in real-time without any human input. They combine a range of sensor data from laser range finders and radars with video and GPS data to generate a detailed 3D map of the environment and estimate their position. The control system of the car uses this information to determine the optimal path to the destination and sends the relevant commands to actuators that control the steering, braking, and throttle

#### Several sources of uncertainty and failure 

*  Unreliable or noisy sensor signals (e.g., GPS data or video signals in bad weather conditions), limitations of computer vision systems, and 
* unexpected changes in the environment (e.g., unknown driving scenes or unexpected accidents on the road) can adversely affect the ability of control system in learning and understanding the environment and making safe decisions.



The importance of epistemic uncertainty or ”uncertainty on uncertainty” in these AI-assisted
systems has been recently recognized, and there are ongoing research efforts towards quantifying
the robustness of self-driving cars to events that are rare (e.g., distance to a bicycle running on
an expected trajectory) or not present in the training data (e.g., unexpected trajectories of moving
objects) [1].  **Systems that recognize such rare events trigger safe fail mechanisms.**

To the best of our knowledge, there is no self-driving car system with an inherently safe design that utilizes, e.g., interpretable models.  Fail-safe mechanisms that upon detection of failures or less confident predictions, stop the autonomous control software and switch to a  backup system or a degraded level of autonomy (e.g., full control by the driver) are considered for self-driving cars [2].
